Hi Welcome to my little repo,

Currently working on some small projects!

Next patches: Unit Testing! Gonna be adding some unit tests to the repository soon.
Structure: Gonna have the dashboard and the classes in a src file. Streamlit is pretty strict with the structure so the dashboards need to be at the root of the repo.


Next project: Using hip hop and billboard lyrics to forecast stock prices!

You can find the dashboards for the projects here:

1) Using Yahoos API, we collect historical data and allow the user to pick signals to trade on. The code back-test the strategy and gives the user their metrics.

2) Dashboard to price exotic options using Monte Carlo simulation.
